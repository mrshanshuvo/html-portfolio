<h1>The Best Movies According to Shuvo</h1>
<h2>My to 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Thor</h3>
This is the first English movie that I really liked when I first had my laptop. I really liked its plot from being unworthy to being worthy again in the eyes of M'jor.
<h3>Twilight Saga</h3>
Again, this movie series was the one of the first movies when I had my laptop. I really like Romantic movies. Because there is so much drama and Romantic scenes that can my heart move.
<h3>Magadheera</h3>
Uff....What a movie masterclass from none other than Ram Charan from South India. I just fall in love with his and one of my first crush Kajal Agarwaal. Just love the neverending love from past to present.
